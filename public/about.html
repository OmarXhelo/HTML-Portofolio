  <h1>About Me</h1>
<p> 
  My name is Omar Xhelo, I am a 19 year old aspiring to become
  a software engineer (AI & Robotics software engineering would be better). 
  This is my very first "project" so far 
  but I'm aiming to build at least 2 proffesional websites that 
  will be used by actual bussinesses before I go to university.
</p>

<p>
 Other goals I'm trying to achieve are:</p> 
 <ol>
  <li>to learn CSS, SQL, Python, JavaScript and hopefully even C++.</li>
  <li>Afterwards, I'll get better at solving LeetCode problems by studying data structures & algorithms</li>
 </ol>  
</p>
<p>
  I should also manage to build a self navigating robot that uses the 
  D* algorithm to get from one place to another before summer of 
  next year ends (It's december).
</p>
<p>
  Oh, I'm also trying to get an internship before making it to 
  Uni as a freshman. That's it, Uhmmm... thx for reading...
